## Syntax
### Comment
Let us write a simple program in ruby. All ruby files will have extension .rb. So, put the following source code in a test.rb file.
```ruby
#
# This is a comment
#
puts 'Hello World!'
```
Now run this file with ruby
```bash
$ ruby test.rb
```
This will produce the following result
```
Hello World!
```
### Reserved words
Since Ruby is case sensitive you can almost use anything for naming except these exact words.
| Reserved | Words |  |  | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BEGIN	| do | next	| then | END |
| else | nil | true | alias | elsif |
| not | undef | and |	end | or |
| unless | begin |	ensure | redo	| until |
| break |	false | rescue | when | case |
| for |	retry |	while | class |	if |
| return | def | in | self | \_\_FILE\_\_ |
| defined? | module | super | \_\_LINE\_\_ | |
### Literals
```ruby
#
# Literals
#
integer = 1
integer_thousands = 1_000 # this is prefered for easy reading but 1000 works as well
float = 1.25

hexadecimal = 0xff

boolean = true # false

string = 'This is a string'
string_double_quotes = "This is a string but used icw #{variable}"

character = 'a' # actually a string but of size 1
special_character = "\n" # special characters need double quotes to work
escape_character = 'That\'s right'

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

hash = { 'key' => 'value', 'key2' => 'value2' } # also called dictonary
hash_symbols = { key: 'value', key2: 'value2' }
```

### Variables, constants and scope
```ruby
#
# Variables, constants and scope
#
CONSTANTS = 'How are you doing?'

def prompt
  puts CONSTANTS
  reply = ARGF.readline
  puts "\nThank you for your reply\n"
  reply
end

local_reply = prompt
puts "Your answer was #{local_reply}"
puts reply # gives error since variable reply is scoped to prompt method
```
