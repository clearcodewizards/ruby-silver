# Basics
This assignment will test your basic ruby skills by doing tiny tasks.

## Task 1
Write a program called main.rb

When you run this program from your terminal by doing a 'ruby main.rb' it should display 'Hello World!'


USE: variable and puts

```ruby
> ruby main.rb
Hello World!
>
```

## Task 2
Change above main.rb so it will ask you to type in text and displays the given text.

USE: variable, puts and gets

```ruby
> ruby main.rb
How are you?
good
Answer: good

```

## Task 3
Change above main.rb so the code which displays the text is put in a method.

Make sure the method uses 1 argument namely the text.
 
USE: variable, puts, gets and def

```ruby
> ruby main.rb
How are you?
good
Answer: good
>
```

## Task 4
In this task we will be using arrays so we need to adjust the current code in main.rb a bit.

You are using gets to get typed text from an user, lets count the words and display it.

USE: variable, puts, gets, def, split, size

```ruby
> ruby main.rb
How are you?
very good
Words: 2
>
> ruby main.rb
How are you?
This test is a bit lame
Words: 6
